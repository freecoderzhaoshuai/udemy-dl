00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:10,110
Hey! This video is going to tell you a little bit about

2
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:12,709
each section in this course, so you get a good idea of what

3
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:13,710
we're going to cover.

4
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:16,889
First, after you get the pre-requirements, like making sure

5
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:19,049
you have a compatible operating system, making sure you

6
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:21,843
download the course repo, stuff like that, we'll get into

7
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,510
the installation details of Docker itself.

8
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:27,469
Docker Desktop works on Mac and Windows 10,

9
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:29,699
and that's really the best thing to do.

10
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:32,039
But, there's lots of other details in there about whether

11
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,590
you're using Linux, or an old Windows version, or you just

12
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:36,240
want to use a server on the Internet.

13
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:39,539
Then we jump into the Docker basics around

14
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:41,991
how do you run containers? What is a container?

15
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:43,710
What's in it? What's not in it?

16
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:45,329
Running some examples.

17
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:47,669
Then we learn how to build the images, which are the

18
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:50,129
building blocks of containers, and you go through some

19
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:51,130
examples of that.

20
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,659
Then I go into details and examples around networking for

21
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:56,399
Docker and how that works.

22
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:58,529
Then maybe some of the storage stuff that you're going to

23
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:00,240
deal with called Volumes.

24
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:02,969
Then, we get into Docker Compose, which is a tool that

25
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:06,239
comes with Docker, but it really is designed for local

26
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,620
Dev and Test, and it's great.

27
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,930
I use it every day when I'm working on projects.

28
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:12,887
Then, after you understand all of the basics of those

29
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,629
tools, we start talking about orchestration, which is

30
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:18,959
allowing you to run containers on multiple servers that act

31
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:20,430
sort of like a single server.

32
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:23,969
We first start out with Swarm because it comes with Docker

33
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,059
out-of-the-box. It's very easy to understand, and it works

34
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:28,500
really great in a lot of scenarios.

35
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:31,800
You'll learn about YAML files and how to configure

36
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:34,329
multi-container solutions, and distributed systems,

37
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:36,299
and micro services and all that.

38
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:39,456
Eventually, you'll want to jump into Kubernetes, which

39
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,840
comes after Swarm.

40
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:44,189
I teach Swarm before Kubernetes because I think it's a good

41
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:46,591
stepping stone because Kubernetes is so much more

42
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:48,724
complicated and does so much more than Swarm.

43
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:51,749
But, Swarm is easy to understand, so it's a great first

44
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:55,080
step. I think all of us really need to learn at least

45
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:57,952
two orchestrators since there's now, I don't know, four or

46
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:00,269
five, six, at least common ones out there.

47
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:03,689
Obviously, Kubernetes gets a lot of the market share and

48
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:07,170
mindshare, but it's not the only solution, and it sometimes

49
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,879
is more complicated than you need.

50
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,427
So, it's good to have multiple tools in your toolset.

51
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,860
That's why I teach both in this course.

52
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:18,060
Then I finish up the course with a bunch of various things

53
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,431
related to all these topics. Things like student's common

54
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,330
questions and answers, maybe some live stuff

55
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:27,240
from my YouTube show where students show up and ask

56
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:29,729
questions about topics in the course that aren't heavily

57
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:31,750
covered, so I give you some more details on that.

58
00:02:31,751 --> 00:02:34,829
Then, I actually review some student real-world

59
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:38,149
Docker and Compose files and sort of break them down,

60
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,319
talk about what's good about them, what's bad about them,

61
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,509
so that you can learn from other people's work.

62
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:46,229
Of course, throughout the whole course, there are tons and

63
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:48,680
tons of references. Anywhere I can, I put links to

64
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:51,680
documentation or really good blog posts that I,

65
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:54,479
or someone else, has made on a topic so you can get further

66
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,089
reading. Then, near the end of the course, I start to give

67
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:59,883
you jumping off points in case you want to take one of my

68
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:02,789
other courses that goes into more detail on that topic,

69
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:04,750
like Swarm Mastery, or maybe Node.js for

70
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:08,729
Docker, or my forthcoming Kubernetes course.

71
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,780
Obviously, no single course is going to solve

72
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,939
all of your problems and have all the answers.

73
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,347
Along with the Slack Chat, and the YouTube,

74
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:20,332
and the Podcast, and the newsletter, and the Q&A, and

75
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:23,823
everything else that we do to try to help you learn these

76
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,219
container tools, you're going to get your questions

77
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:27,240
answered, one way or another.

78
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:30,359
Of course, the nice thing about the Slack community is

79
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,699
there's tons of people in there that are happy to help you,

80
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,477
who have a wide range of backgrounds, and it's really

81
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:37,889
great. I'm really excited that we've had a lot of people

82
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:40,649
stick around over the years and build that community with

83
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:41,826
us. Thanks for watching.

84
00:03:42,314 --> 00:03:43,759
I'll see the next video.
